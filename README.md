# 🦝 Raccoon Café: Brew & Serve ☕

Welcome to **Raccoon Café**, a cozy pixel-art game where you're the barista at the cutest café in town — and your customers? Adorable raccoons with a serious love for coffee!

## 🎮 Gameplay

In **Raccoon Café**, your goal is to keep the raccoons happy by:

- **Brewing coffee** using the coffee machine
- **Dragging cups** to the raccoon that appears
- **Cleaning up** using the trash can
- **Ringing up** using the register
- Watching for **sparkles of joy** when raccoons are satisfied!

Each raccoon will request a random number of cups — meet their needs and they'll shuffle out of the café, making room for the next customer.
